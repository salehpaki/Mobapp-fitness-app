# Mobapp-fitness-app
As part of our Database course project at the university, we developed a comprehensive mobile application called Fitness App using React Native. 
The app features a well-designed graphical user interface (GUI) and integrates various functionalities such as 
workout tracking, meal planning, progress monitoring, and user profile management. It demonstrates practical 
application of database concepts by efficiently managing and retrieving user data, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.
